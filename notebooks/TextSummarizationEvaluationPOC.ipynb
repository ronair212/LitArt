    "text = '''Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn't something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you. Something inside of you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn't get in, and walk through it, step by step. There's no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones. That's the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine. And that's exactly what I do. I imagine a white funnel stretching up vertically like a thick rope. My eyes are closed tight, hands cupped over my ears, so those fine grains of sand can't blow inside me. The sandstorm draws steadily closer. I can feel the air pressing on my skin. It really is going to swallow me up. The boy called Crow softly rests a hand on my shoulder, and with that the storm vanishes. \"From now on--no matter what--you've got to be the world's toughest fifteenyear-old. That's the only way you're going to survive. And in order to do that, you've got to figure out what it means to be tough. You following me?\" I keep my eyes closed and don't reply. I just want to sink off into sleep like this, his hand on my shoulder. I hear the faint flutter of wings. \"You're going to be the world's toughest fifteen-year-old,\" Crow whispers as I try to fall asleep. Like he was carving the words in a deep blue tattoo on my heart.'''"

Her hair was as silver as the moonlight that bathed the village in a gentle glow, and her eyes sparkled with the curiosity of a thousand stars. Elara was no ordinary child; she possessed an innate ability to communicate with the natural world around her, a secret she held close to her heart.\n",

The forest was in danger; a darkness had begun to creep through the woods, wilting flowers and withering trees with its malevolent touch.\n",

Realizing the peril, Elara drew upon her connection with the natural world, calling forth an assembly of creatures great and small. Owls took flight, their wings casting shadows like silent warriors; foxes darted through the underbrush, their eyes gleaming with determination; even the trees bent their branches, ready to protect their home.\n",

    "With the forest at her back, Elara confronted the sorcerer, her resolve as strong as the ancient oak itself. The battle was fierce, with the sorcerer's dark magic clashing against the pure, untamed power of nature.
